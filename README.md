# twitter-clone-vanilla-js
This project is a simple clone of Twitterâ€™s front-end built using modern JavaScript (Vanilla JS), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It allows users to register, log in, post tweets, and manage profiles. Tweets and user data are stored using local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions.
